        <h1>Motivation</h1>
        <p>
            With our system, users will be able to filter programs and festivals according to their individual tastes,
        such as identity, music, food, etc. We started with the question “What is there to do in Ottawa?” then narrowed it down
        to “What activities are there for university students who like arts & crafts?” 
        </p>

    <div class="info">
        <h1>Data</h1>
        <p>
            We have two datasets, one for winter programs from 2019, and one of cultural festivals in and around the city of Ottawa.

        <h1>Task Analysis</h1>
        <p>
            During the interview with Prof Sprague, it quickly become clear that he, specifically was only interested in indoor
            dining. Prof Sprague is only one data point and since his interests were quite narrow he went against our initial
            assumption of what people wanted from the capital. Even so, it reaffirmed our conclusion that we needed to focus more on
            category/type over location. So that became our main task: to show users festivals and programs of the category they
            liked rather than show them all the events Ottawa had to offer.
